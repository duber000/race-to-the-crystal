This directory contains background music files for the game.

Currently, the game looks for: `techno.mp3` or `techno.wav`

## Auto-Generated Music

The game now automatically generates a simple techno beat on startup if no music file is found. The generated track includes:

- Bass drum kicks
- Hi-hat patterns
- Simple synth bassline
- Melodic synth elements

The music is generated using Python's standard library and doesn't require external audio files.

## Custom Music

If you want to use your own music:
1. Place your techno music file named `techno.mp3` in this directory
2. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC
3. The music will loop automatically during gameplay
4. Recommended: Use royalty-free techno/electronic music

Music Controls:
- Press `M` to toggle music on/off

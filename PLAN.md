## Overview
Build a networked multiplayer vector graphics game for 2-4 players using Python with clean geometric Tron-style visuals.

**⚠️ Technology Stack Update**: Currently implemented with Pygame. Migration to **Arcade + PyGaSe + GIL-free Python 3.13t** planned for better performance and modern architecture. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for details.

## Game Summary
- 4-player strategic board game on a grid
- Each player starts with 20 dice tokens (health: 10, 8, 6, 4) from corner positions
- Goal: Capture central power crystal and hold for 3 turns with 12 tokens
- 4 generators can be disabled to reduce crystal requirements
- Turn-based combat and movement
- Mystery squares with random effects

## Technical Architecture

### Network Design
- **Model**: Client-Server (server-authoritative)
- **Transport**: TCP sockets with JSON messages
- **Synchronization**: Server validates all actions, broadcasts state updates
- **Lobby**: Players join/create games, ready up, then start

### Key Design Decisions

**Turn-Based System**
- Each player's turn: Movement → Action (Attack/Capture) → End Turn
- Server validates moves before applying
- 30-second timer per turn
- No client-side prediction needed (turn-based allows waiting for server)

**State Management**
- Server maintains single authoritative GameState
- Full state sync on join/reconnect
- Delta updates for actions during gameplay
- GameState serializes to JSON for network transmission

**Movement**
- All tokens move 2 spaces per turn
- 8-directional movement (including diagonals)
- BFS pathfinding to calculate valid destinations
- Cannot move through other tokens

**Combat**
- Adjacent attacks only
- Damage = attacker.health // 2 (no damage to attacker)
- If defender health ≤ 0, token is removed

**Generators**
- Hold with 2+ tokens for 2 consecutive turns to disable
- Each disabled generator reduces crystal requirement by 2 tokens
- 4 generators total (one per quadrant)

**Crystal Capture & Win**
- Base requirement: 12 tokens for 3 turns
- Adjusted by disabled generators: 12 - (disabled_count * 2)
- First player to meet requirement wins

**Mystery Squares**
- Random coin flip when token lands on square
- Heads: Heal to full health
- Tails: Teleport back to starting position
- 8-12 total (2-3 per quadrant)

### Visual Style (Tron-Inspired)
- Dark background (#0a0a0f)
- Neon glow effects on all elements
- Player colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Green
- Smooth animations for movement and combat
- Vector graphics using pygame.draw primitives

### Network Protocol

**Message Types**:
- Connection: CONNECT, DISCONNECT, HEARTBEAT
- Lobby: JOIN_LOBBY, READY, START_GAME
- Actions: MOVE_TOKEN, ATTACK, CAPTURE_GENERATOR, CAPTURE_CRYSTAL
- Updates: FULL_STATE, STATE_UPDATE, TURN_CHANGE
- Events: COMBAT_RESULT, MYSTERY_EVENT, GAME_WON

**Message Format** (JSON):
```json
{
  "type": "MOVE_TOKEN",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "player_id": "uuid-string",
  "data": {
    "token_id": 5,
    "from": [2, 3],
    "to": [4, 3]
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

**Current (Pygame Implementation)**:
```
pygame>=2.5.0              # Graphics and game loop (requires SDL2 system libs)
pytest>=8.0.0              # Testing framework
```

**Planned (Arcade Migration)** - See MIGRATION.md:
```
arcade>=2.6.17             # Modern OpenGL game framework
pygase>=0.4.0              # Game networking library
pytest>=8.0.0              # Testing framework
Python 3.13t               # Free-threaded (GIL-free) build

2. Implement turn timer with auto-forfeit
3. Add in-game chat
4. Create main menu and settings screen
5. Add victory screen with statistics
6. Implement spectator mode
7. Handle all edge cases (simultaneous disconnects, invalid moves)
8. Performance optimization (60 FPS, <100ms server response)
9. Comprehensive testing (integration, stress tests, playtesting)

**Deliverable**: Polished, release-ready game

### Phase 5: Deployment
**Goal**: Ready for distribution

**Tasks**:
1. Write user documentation (setup, gameplay, controls)
2. Create installation/setup scripts
3. Package game for distribution
4. Bug fixes from playtesting
5. Balance adjustments based on feedback

## Key Implementation Notes

### Separation of Concerns
- Game logic (game/) is completely independent of rendering and networking
- Enables thorough unit testing
- Client and server share game logic code

### Server-Authoritative Model
- Server validates ALL actions before applying
- Prevents cheating and ensures consistency
- Clients never modify state directly

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all game logic (movement, combat, win conditions)
- Integration tests for network message handling
- Playtesting: 2-player, 4-player, 2v2 team scenarios
- Stress testing: disconnects, latency simulation, concurrent games

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS rendering (smooth animations)
- <100ms server response time
- Support 4 concurrent games per server instance

## Risks & Mitigations

**Network sync complexity** → Turn-based design simplifies synchronization (or PyGaSe auto-sync)
**Rendering performance** → Migrating to Arcade (GPU-accelerated) for 60+ FPS
**Python GIL limitations** → Python 3.13t free-threaded build for true parallelism
**Runaway leader** → Mystery squares can reset leading players
**Games too long** → Turn timers and automatic forfeit
**Spawn camping** → Can add spawn protection if needed during playtesting
**Migration risk** → Phased approach available; Pygame implementation complete as fallback

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Completed** (Phases 1 & 2):
1. ✅ Core game logic with 140 passing unit tests
2. ✅ Complete Tron-style UI with local hot-seat gameplay
3. ✅ 2,700+ lines of rendering code
4. ✅ Full camera, input, and HUD systems

**Next Steps**:

**Option A: Continue with Pygame** (Original Plan)
- Install SDL2 development libraries
- Proceed with Phase 3: Network Infrastructure (custom TCP)

**Option B: Migrate to Modern Stack** (Recommended - see MIGRATION.md)
- Switch to Python 3.13t (GIL-free)
- Migrate rendering to Arcade (GPU-accelerated)
- Use PyGaSe for networking (90% less code)
- Enable true multi-threading
- Timeline: 16-22 hours

**Decision Point**: Choose path forward before proceeding to networking.
